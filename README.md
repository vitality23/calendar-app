# calendar-app
For this assignment we had to make a calnder app, within this app we had to make it color coded as well. when inputting something on the calendar it saves after relaod of page, 
it shows what time of day it is, and it shows if its too late to input something in for that day. In mine i did everything accordingly, so in theory it should work, but I feel 
like i may have missed something, if any notes I would love to know 

## here is what i have
